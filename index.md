* **A demo of the automatic headache diagnose**

    We have designed a simple interactive diagnostic system to determine whether the user has a primary headache. This system simulates the user's real consultation process, and the diagnosis of primary headache can be completed through the audio conversation between the user and the system.

    The code of this project can be found here: [A demo of the Automatic headache diagnose](https://github.com/Intel-PA/diagnose_demo)
